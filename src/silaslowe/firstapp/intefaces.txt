BEST PRACTICES:

Use many small interfaces
    Single methd interfaces are some of the most powerful and flexible
        io.Writer, io.Reader, interface{}

Don't export interfaces for types that will be consumed

Do export interfaces fot types that will be used by package

Design methods and functions to recieve interfaces whenver possible

Review:

In interfaces wea re describing behaviors

Implement the interface by creating methids with the same stignature
